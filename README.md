# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Introduction

Motivation

Working on the heart disease dataset was motivated by the fact that heart disease claims millions of lives each year
and is a major cause of death globally. Working with this dataset will help us understand the different risk factors
that lead to heart disease and create models that can predict a person's chance of developing the condition in their
lifetime.

Goal of the project

My goal on this project by using machine learning algorithms to predict the life hood of a person developing heart
disease based on their demographic and health-related attributes. This could help doctors and healthcare providers
identify high-risk patients early on and take preventive measures. By analyzing the heart disease dataset, we can gain
insights into the various risk factors that contribute to heart disease, such as age, gender, painloc, cholesterol levels,
and fasting blood sugar. This knowledge can be used to educate people about the importance of healthy lifestyle
choices and early intervention. By understanding the factors that contribute to heart disease and predicting the life
hood of developing heart disease, you can develop personalized treatment plans that are tailored to each patient's
needs. This can improve treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.

Why it is interesting

The heart disease dataset is multi-disciplinary, involving fields such as cardiology, epidemiology, and machine
learning. This provides an opportunity to collaborate with experts from different fields and develop innovative
solutions to address heart disease. Heart disease affects different populations differently, and by analyzing the heart
disease dataset, we can identify healthcare disparities that exist and develop targeted interventions to address them.
This can help reduce healthcare inequities and improve health outcomes for all.

Why machine learning is a reasonable approach

Machine learning is best approach of heart disease dataset contains many variables, and the relationships between
these variables can be complex. Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and relationships in the data that
may not be apparent using traditional statistical methods. The relationships between variables in the heart disease
dataset may not be linear, which makes traditional statistical methods less effective. Machine learning algorithms
can model nonlinear relationships and identify complex interactions between variables. One of the main goals of
analyzing the heart disease dataset is to predict the life hood of a person developing heart disease. Machine learning
algorithms can be trained on the data to make accurate predictions, which can help healthcare providers identify
high-risk patients and take preventive measures. Where machine learning is a reasonable approach for analyzing the
heart disease dataset because it can create complex model relationships between variables and make accurate
predictions for developing personalized treatment plans, and scale to handle large amounts of data.

The dataset contains 14 attributes and 303 records here the predict the heart diseases with machine learning
algorithm we use patients.

• age

• sex

• cp (chest pain type)

• trestbps (resting blood pressure)

• chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)

• fbs (fasting blood sugar >120mg/dl(1=true;0=false)),

• restecg (resting electrocardiographic results [ value 0 : normal, value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T
wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), Value 2: showing probable or definite left
ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria] )

• Thalach (maximum herat rate achieved)

• exang(exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no))

• oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)

• slope (the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [ Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: down sloping
])

• ca (number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy)

• thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

• num: diagnosis of heart disease ((angiographic disease status [ Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing, Value 1:
50% diameter narrowing (in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels) ]).

Dataset Description:

The heart disease dataset is a publicly available dataset that was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset was created by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio, USA, and contains data on
patients who were referred to the clinic for chest pain evaluation. The data was collected between 1988 and 1990,
and includes demographic information, clinical measurements, and medical history data for a total of 303
patients.The dataset was originally created to investigate the use of machine learning algorithms for predicting the
presence or absence of heart disease based on patient data. It has since become a popular benchmark dataset for
evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms for classification tasks in healthcare.

Conclusion:

The random forest algorithm used in this project produced a model that explained approximately 41.6% of the
variance in the predicted attribute. While the predicted probabilities generated by the model can be evaluated against
the true labels to assess accuracy, further analysis would be necessary to determine the overall performance of the
model. Overall, the heart disease dataset and machine learning algorithms offer a promising approach to predicting
and preventing heart disease, which is an important public health concern worldwide.
